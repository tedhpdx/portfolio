With graduate school on the horizon I hope to start in industry as soon as possible.  I am looking forward to learning more about the industry and learning how and where I will fit into it.   I’m hoping to learn more about machine learning and AI and see what I can do to find position in that field.  Security is another field I’m quite interested in.  I am now working to get that foot in the door, then the next steps will come.
