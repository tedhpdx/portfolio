My first trip out of country, I was in high school, I was with my folks.  Traveled around London and surrounding areas, had Guinness in Dublin, went to a the small Irish village of Ennis for folk music.  Upon our return to England we went to Whitby for more folk music.  Great fish and chips in Whitby.  Pretty sweet trip for a kid.
