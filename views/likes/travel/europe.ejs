Though my travel through Europe hasn’t been extensive I’m happy with what I’ve got.  Amsterdam has been kind to me the two times I’ve been there as Brussels though I’ve only been there once.  

I’ve also spent a good deal of time in Italy, once I was in Rome for two weeks, then moving onto a quick trip trough Florence only to fly to Sicily for a couple weeks.  

On another trip I got to spend 2 weeks in Venice.  Venice is monumentally special.  During that trip I had the good fortune to return to Florence a second time, this time just a quick overnight journey to have a steak Florentine.
