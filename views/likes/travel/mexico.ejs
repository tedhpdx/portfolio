First trip out of country by myself.  Took this trip during the summer as a student at PSU to meet a professor I had recently studied under.  I spent two weeks in Mexico City and then another in Puebla, what great people and great food everywhere.  Ran into a little trouble after a friend came to meet me back in Mexico City when we were liberated of our belongings.  I left Mexico after that.
