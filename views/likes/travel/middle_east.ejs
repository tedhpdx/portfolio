My experience here is limited but rich.  Having lived in Abu Arish, Saudi Arabia by experience was quite colorful.  Met lots of great folks though, pretty isolated down there.  Went swimming in the Red Sea a couple times, there were flying fish.  Kinda hot.  Had a chance to go to Dubai for a couple days,  that’s a crazy city.  It’s also hot there.  

Upon leaving Saudi I made a pit stop in Istanbul for a couple weeks.  It was a perfect place to transition from the Arab world to the western world.  The Bosphorus is super neat.  I took a bus to Turkey that was also neat.  They sell steamed hamburgers on the street, they are pretty dang good.
