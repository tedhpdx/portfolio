Southeast Asia is where Iâ€™ve really cut my teeth as a traveler.  After finishing my teaching training I traveled for four months.  From Thailand to Cambodia to Vietnam To Laos, back to Thailand, down to Malaysia and finally back to Thailand.  Took a boat down the Mekong river for two days.   

Then I began teaching in Vietnam.  I would travel all the time, I traveled the region extensively, especially Vietnam as I had some of the best guides you could have.  It was spectacular.  Made return journeys to all the countries mentioned, as well as Singapore.  I feel like there is still so much to see.   What an experience.  I was there nearly five years.
