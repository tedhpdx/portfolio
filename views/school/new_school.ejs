After getting settled in New York, I got a flyer in the mail advertising a BA program for nontraditional students at the New School University.  I applied, I was accepted, I arranged funding and I started.  A fantastic program where I designed my own curriculum and finished with a BA in Liberal Arts.  During my time there I focused on democratic theory and memoir writing.  After I finished it was time to leave NYC.
