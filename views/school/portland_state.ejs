After my first year of college at SOU in Ashland, Or  I decided the small town life was not for me and I moved back to Portland to attend Portland State University.  Though young and unguided I still enjoyed much of what I put into my first couple years at school.  However family turmoil stuck my second year in and I took some time off to reevaluate.  

It wasnâ€™t for another year that I returned to school, not in Portland but in New York City.

Now having returner to PSU it is quite a different experience.  Having a definite goal and a clear plan is leading me down a whole new road.  Graduate school in CS is scheduled to start Fall 2019.
