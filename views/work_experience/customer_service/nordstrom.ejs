I think my first time working for Nordstrom I was still in high school,  and worked for them on-and-off until I moved to NYC.  My initial customer service training coming from here and it’s stuff that really shaped the way I handle customers/guests/clients.  

Here I worked a few different positions but I finally ended up getting a sales position at the downtown Portland location selling men’s shoes.  It was a great gig and I did quite well, though I did finally leave after finalizing my plans to move back east.
