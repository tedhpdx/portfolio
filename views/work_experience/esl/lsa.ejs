After a few months traveling around the US, I was offered a Job with the London School Of English at their new school location in Abu Arish, Saudi Arabia.

In the ESL world, the jobs in the gulf states are stuff of legend.  Stories of high salaries, paid apartments, first class flights for visa runs and private drivers for running errands.  For me these all turned out to be true.  Though there were these upsides, there were myriad downsides.  No sense listing them here but it was a challenging place to work and live.  After six months my contract finished and I decided it was time for a big change.
